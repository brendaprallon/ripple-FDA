### Abstract
This work proposes a classification model for predicting the main activity of bitcoin addresses based on their balances. Since the balances are a function of time, we apply functional data analysis methods; more specifically, the features of the proposed models are the functional principal components. Classifying bitcoin addresses is a relevant problem for two main reasons: to understand how the bitcoin market works, and to identify accounts used for illicit activities. Although other bitcoin classifiers have been proposed, they focus primarily on network analysis rather than curve behavior.
